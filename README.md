** About The Project

Quantum-Core is a futuristic AR-style Human–Computer Interaction system that turns your hand into a live holographic controller.

It tracks real-time hand landmarks through your webcam and renders a cyber energy core that dynamically responds to natural hand movements — just like sci-fi movie interfaces.

No mouse.
No keyboard.
Just your hand.
